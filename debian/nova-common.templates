Template: nova/start_services
Type: boolean

 machine is booted up.

 this is also the URL of your OpenStack Identity Service (Keystone).

Template: nova/configure_db
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Set up a database for Nova?
 No database has been set up for Nova to use. If you want
 to set one up now, please make sure you have all needed
 information:
 .
  * the host name of the database server (which must allow TCP
    connections from this machine);
  * a username and password to access the database;
  * the type of database management software you want to use.
 .
 If you don't choose this option, no database will be set up and Nova
 will use regular SQLite support.
 .
 You can change this setting later on by running "dpkg-reconfigure
 -plow nova-common".

Template: nova/active-api
Type: multiselect
Choices: ec2, osapi_compute, metadata, osapi_volume
_Description: API to activate:
 Openstack Nova supports different API services, each of them binding on a
 different port. Select which one nova-api should support.
 .
 If it is a compute node that you are setting-up, then you only need to run the
 metadata API server. If you run Cinder, then you don't need osapi_volume (you
 cannot run osapi_volume and cinder-api on the same server: they bind on the
 same port).
