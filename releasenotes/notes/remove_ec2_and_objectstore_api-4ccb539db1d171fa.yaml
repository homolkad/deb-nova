upgrade:
  - |
    All code and tests for Nova's EC2 and ObjectStore API support which
    was deprecated in Kilo
    (https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/ReleaseNotes/Kilo#Upgrade_Notes_2) has
    been completely removed in Mitaka. This has been replaced by the new
    ec2-api project (http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/ec2-api/).

    .. warning:: Some installation tools (such as ``packstack``) hardcode the
      value of ``enabled_apis`` in your nova.conf. While the defaults
      for ``enabled_apis`` dropped ``ec2`` as a value, if that is hard
      coded in your nova.conf, you will need to remove it before
      restarting Nova's API server, or it will not start.
