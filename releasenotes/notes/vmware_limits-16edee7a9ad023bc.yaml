features:
  - quota:cpu_limit - (VMware only) The cpu of a virtual machine will not
    exceed this limit, even if there are available resources. This is
    typically used to ensure a consistent performance of virtual machines
    independent of available resources. Units are MHz.
  - quota:cpu_reservation - (VMware only) guaranteed minimum reservation (MHz)
  - quota:cpu_shares_level - (VMware only) the allocation level. This can be
    'custom', 'high', 'normal' or 'low'.
  - quota:cpu_shares_share - (VMware only) in the event that 'custom' is used,
    this is the number of shares.
  - quota:memory_limit - (VMware only) The memory utilization of a virtual
    machine will not exceed this limit, even if there are available resources.
    This is typically used to ensure a consistent performance of virtual machines
    independent of available resources. Units are MB.
  - quota:memory_reservation - (VMware only) guaranteed minimum reservation (MB)
  - quota:memory_shares_level - (VMware only) the allocation level. This can be
    'custom', 'high', 'normal' or 'low'.
  - quota:memory_shares_share - (VMware only) in the event that 'custom' is used,
    this is the number of shares.
  - quota:disk_io_limit - (VMware only) The I/O utilization of a virtual machine
    will not exceed this limit. The unit is number of I/O per second.
  - quota:disk_io_reservation - (VMware only) Reservation control is used to
    provide guaranteed allocation in terms of IOPS
  - quota:disk_io_shares_level - (VMware only) the allocation level. This can be
    'custom', 'high', 'normal' or 'low'.
  - quota:disk_io_shares_share - (VMware only) in the event that 'custom' is used,
    this is the number of shares.
  - quota:vif_limit - (VMware only) The bandwidth limit for the virtual network
    adapter. The utilization of the virtual network adapter will not exceed this
    limit, even if there are available resources. Units in Mbits/sec.
  - quota:vif_reservation - (VMware only) Amount of network bandwidth that is
    guaranteed to the virtual network adapter. If utilization is less than
    reservation, the resource can be used by other virtual network adapters.
    Reservation is not allowed to exceed the value of limit if limit is set.
    Units in Mbits/sec.
  - quota:vif_shares_level - (VMware only) the allocation level. This can be
    'custom', 'high', 'normal' or 'low'.
  - quota:vif_shares_share - (VMware only) in the event that 'custom' is used,
    this is the number of shares.
