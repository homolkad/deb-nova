    A new ``auto`` value for the configuration option
    ``upgrade_levels.compute`` is accepted, that allows automatic determination
    of the compute service version to use for RPC communication. By default, we
    still use the newest version if not set in the config, a specific version
    if asked, and only do this automatic behavior if 'auto' is configured.
