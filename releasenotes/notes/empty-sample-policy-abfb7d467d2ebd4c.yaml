    The API policy defaults are now defined in code like configuration options.
    Because of this, the sample policy.json file that is shipped with Nova is
    empty and should only be necessary if you want to override the API policy
    from the defaults in the code. To generate the policy file you can run::

      oslopolicy-sample-generator --config-file=etc/nova/nova-policy-generator.conf
