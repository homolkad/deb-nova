# This script is executed in the OpenStack CI *tempest-dsvm-lxc job.
# It's used to configure which tempest tests actually get run.  You can find
# the CI job configuration here:

# http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/project-config/tree/jenkins/jobs/devstack-gate.yaml
#

# Construct a regex to use when limiting scope of tempest
# to avoid features unsupported by Nova's LXC support.

# Note that several tests are disabled by the use of tempest
# feature toggles in devstack/lib/tempest for an lxc config,
# so this regex is not entirely representative of what's excluded.

# When adding entries to the regex, add a comment explaining why
# since this list should not grow.
